            <h1>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.</h1>
            <p>I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.</p>
            <p>All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Saving the world with meals on wheels. <strong> Heh-haa!</strong> <em> Super squeaky bum time!</em> You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
            <h2>You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?</h2>
            <p>I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.</p>

            <h3>You hit me with a cricket bat.</h3>
            <p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>
            <ul>
            
            <li>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.</li><li>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.</li><li>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</li>

            <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant. You've swallowed a planet!</p>
            <p>I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?</p>

            <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>
            <p>It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.</p>
